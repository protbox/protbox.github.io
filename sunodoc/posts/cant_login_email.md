# I can't log in with my email address!

Suno accounts are most often connected to an email address, but they do not use the email/password format to sign up or sign in. Instead, they use Single Sign On (SSO) with connected logins from Apple, Discord, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.

If you have the same email to sign into Facebook and Google, for example, please use the method you selected during sign up!

If you sign in and do not see your previous songs in your Library, there's a good chance you have more than one account. Contact the Suno support team at [support@suno.com](mailto:support@suno.com) so they can help you navigate and recover your account details. They can also help you merge accounts if you have songs in two or more accounts!
