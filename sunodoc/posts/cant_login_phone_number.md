# I can't log in with my phone number!

There are two common issues with logging in with a phone number:

- You enter a number but never receive an OTP (one-time passcode)
- You attempt to log in but receive an error about being from a restricted region

If you're experiencing either of these, please let the Suno support team know by emailing [support@suno.com](mailto:support@suno.com)

They can't always fix these, but it's important to stress that Suno does not want to restrict you from making music. A restriction in certain regions could be in place due to an uptick in suspicious or unusual activity, and is often not permanent. Suno takes your account security seriously, and these can be helpful in keeping all Suno users safe!

To resolve this, they may request that you start a new account using one of the SSO login methods such as Login via Google. With this, you simply enter the same information as if you were signing into your gmail account. After setting up your new account, their team can help with moving any existing music and credits to your new account so you can access your songs and keep making music!
