# How do I get help?

If you would like to help yourself, [help.suno.com](http://help.suno.com/) is the best place to start. Just navigate to the search bar and type any key words. Your search results will include any articles with those words!

Otherwise, the only official support contact for Suno support is [support@suno.com](mailto:support@suno.com), while billing requests can be sent to [billing@suno.com](mailto:billing@suno.com). Their team is ready to help with using Suno, including making music, billing, etc. If you see other emails from suno.com, these are typically from their team for the purposes of contests or information, and they are not support channels.

Outside of official support, you may be able to find help within the Suno community through resources such as Discord. You can join the discord by clicking [here](https://discord.com/invite/suno). Please note: while their team is active on Discord, most interaction is peer-to-peer. Discord **is not considered an official support channel**. This is a great place to share links, talk about features, and learn more tips and tricks from passionate Suno users!
