# How do I change my billing details?

You can update your billing information by visiting [suno.com/account](https://suno.com/account) then choosing Update Payment within your subscription details. This area is only visible if you are actively subscribed!

After choosing Update Payment, you will be redirected to Suno's payment processor, Stripe, where you will find an area to update your billing information.

If you have subscribed on iOS or Android, you will need to visit the App Store or Google Play Store to make changes.
